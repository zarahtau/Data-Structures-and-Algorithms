# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This repository is dedicated to providing implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++. It serves as a resource for learning such fundamentals focusing on sorting techniques, binary trees, hash maps, and graphs.

## Features
* __Sorting Techniques__: Implementations of key sorting algorithms using a student database example. Sorting techniques include but are not limited to, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
* __Binary Trees__ (coming soon): Examples of binary search trees showcasing operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal
* __Hashing__: Demonstration of collision management in hash functions using separate chaining and linear probing
* __Graphs__ (coming soon): Graph representations and algorithms for traversing

## Getting Started
Navigate to the desired section to explore implementations. Each directory contains source code and a README. Contributions are welcome! If you have an implementation, optimization, or explanation that can enhance this resource, please submit a pull request.
